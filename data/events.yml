      A Barcamp style event in Belgium. Let's learn about Svelte through some
      presentations and some coding together. Location to be decided, but
      probably a classroom or shared office in Ghent or Antwerp. If you are a
      school or have a location and interested in hosting this event, get in
      touch!



      Timing to be decided, probably in the coming 2-3 months. Beginning of
      December seems realistic.

      It is not cool to have a WordPress template full of jQuery animations
      anymore. We can do way better and we all know it. But creating client side
      app in React for a web presentation will introduce its own set of
      problems. 


      We will show you how you to create a presentation based on a headless CMS
      with Svelte and Sapper, a universal JavaScript framework with server-side
      rendering and very low runtime overhead.
